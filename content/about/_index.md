## Awooo! I'm Wolfiii🐺

Hi, I'm Wolfiii, a 23-year-old gray wolf furry living in southern Germany. I've been part of the furry fandom for 4 years now, and it's been an incredible journey! I absolutely love the community, and since last year, I’ve been attending conventions—getting to meet other furries, suit up, and embrace the fandom even more!

When I’m not in my furry headspace, I’m working in IT, playing video games, or hanging out with my friends. I enjoy singing, listening to all kinds of music, hiking, and traveling, especially with my amazing boyfriend by my side.

On this site, I'll be sharing my personal experiences as a furry—everything from convention stories to helpful tips and tricks for fellow furries. I want to create a space where I can document my furry journey and maybe help others along the way. So, grab your tail and ears, and join me on this adventure! 😊
